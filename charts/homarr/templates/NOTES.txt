Homarr has been installed!

1. If you enabled ingress, access using:

    http://media-servarr.local/

    You may need to point `media-servarr.local` to your kubernetes host first!

2. Login Details:

  By default, AuthenticationMethod is set to External - meaning no authentication required. You can change this by changing the `application.config`.

  If you are planning on allowing access over the intern **add authentication**

3. Configure Homarr:

  - Homarr will start with a Wizard to set a username and password
  - View how to set up integrations and dashboards at the [official documentation](https://homarr.dev)

4. Persisting Data:

   By default, your Homarr installation is configured to store data in a local persistent volume.
