Transmission has been installed!

1. If you enabled ingress, access using:

    http://media-servarr.local/transmission/

    You may need to point `media-servarr.local` to your kubernetes host first!

2. Configure Transmission:

   - You can start adding torrents
   - To automate movie downloads, configure indexers and download clients in the Settings menu.
   - Change how the container runs by adjusting the `application.config.contents`. View [the docs](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/blob/main/docs/Editing-Configuration-Files.md] for more information.
