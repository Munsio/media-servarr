Radarr has been installed!

1. If you enabled ingress, access using:

    http://media-servarr.local/radarr/

    You may need to point `media-servarr.local` to your kubernetes host first!

2. Login Details:

  By default, AuthenticationMethod is set to External - meaning no authentication required. You can change this by changing the `application.config`.

  If you are planning on allowing access over the intern **add authentication**

3. Configure Radarr:

   - You can start adding movies by clicking on "Add Movies" in the Radarr web UI.
   - To automate movie downloads, configure indexers and download clients in the Settings menu.
   - Change how the container runs by adjusting the `application.config.contents`. View https://wiki.servarr.com/radarr/settings for more information.

   By default, your Radarr installation is configured to store data in a persistent volume at `/path/to/your/data`. Ensure that this path is backed up regularly.
