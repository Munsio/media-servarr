Prowlarr has been installed!

1. If you enabled ingress, access using:

    http://media-servarr.local/prowlarr/

    You may need to point `media-servarr.local` to your kubernetes host first!

2. Login Details:

  By default, AuthenticationMethod is set to External - meaning no authentication required. You can change this by changing the `application.config`.

  If you are planning on allowing access over the internet **add authentication**

3. Configure Prowlarr:

   - You can start adding telvision shows by clicking on "Add New Indexer" in the Prowlarr web UI.
   - Change how the container runs by adjusting the `application.config.contents`. View https://wiki.servarr.com/prowlarr/settings for more information.

4. Persisting Data:

   By default, your Prowlarr installation is configured to store data in a local persistent volume.
