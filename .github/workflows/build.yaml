          # FIXME: Some issues with this job step that should be fixed and considered:
          # 1. We assume the tag will be semvar. There is no checking or protections if not.
          # 2. The previous tag is the last tag - and can be on any branch. We do not have any
          #   branch checking to make sure the comparison is logical
          # 3. Semvar metadata is carried over to the updated version. However, future comparisons
          #   will include this, meaning -dev and -alpha releases may have unintended consequences
          # 4. If the Chart.yaml version is updated as part of the diff, then it will be bumped up
          #   again as part of this script. We should check the diffs and skip if so
